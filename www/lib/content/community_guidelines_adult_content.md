### COMMUNITY GUIDELINES - ADULT CONTENT


#### Core Principles
At the heart of these guidelines are four fundamental principles:

- Safety and Legality: All content must adhere to applicable laws and regulations. Gelesen has a zero-tolerance policy for illegal content and activities.
- Consent: All participants in adult content must be of legal age and have provided their free, enthusiastic, and ongoing consent.
- Transparency: The rules governing adult content are clearly defined, publicly accessible, and consistently enforced.
- Age Assurance: Robust mechanisms are in place to verify the age of users before accessing and contributing to adult content.

#### Section 1: Prohibited Content
The following types of content are strictly prohibited and will be subject to immediate removal, with corresponding accounts facing penalties, including permanent suspension.

- **Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM)**
    - Any depiction, whether real or simulated, of individuals under the legal age of majority (typically 18 years old) in a sexualized context. This includes created, distributed, or stored CSAM.

- **Non-Consensual Content**
    - Any content that depicts sexual acts or nudity without the explicit and ongoing consent of all participants. This includes, but is not limited to, "revenge porn" and unauthorized distribution of private images.

- **Paraphilia & Fetish Content**
    - All paraphilias and fetishes are prohibited on Gelesen unless explicitly allowed or tolerated by us. This means that content depicting, promoting, or discussing any paraphilia or fetish is generally not permitted. We reserve the sole right to determine what content falls under this prohibition and what, if anything, may be explicitly allowed or tolerated. Any such explicit allowances will be clearly communicated through our official channels.

- **Violence and Harm**
    - Content that depicts or incites extreme violence, sexual assault, torture, or any form of physical or psychological harm to individuals or animals.
- **Non-Human or Non-Consensual Simulation**
    - AI-generated or animated depictions involving non-human entities (animals, monsters, etc.) in sexual contexts, or simulations of non-consensual acts, are not permitted.

#### Section 2: Restricted Content
The following types of content, while not strictly prohibited, are subject to restrictions to ensure a safe and age-appropriate experience for all users.

- **Sexually Explicit Content**
    - Content depicting real or simulated sexual acts, including intercourse, oral sex, and masturbation. This content must be clearly labeled as "Adult Content", "Sensitive Content", or "NSFW Content".

- **Nudity & Partial Nudity**
    - Depictions of nudity are permissible for adult audiences. This content must be age labeled correctly depending on its intensity and context. Context will be considered, with artistic and educational depictions subject to review.

- **Sexually Suggestive Content**
    - Content that is not sexually explicit but is intended to be sexually provocative. This content may be subject to age-gating and labeling requirements depending on its intensity and context.

- **AI-Generated Adult Content**

    AI-generated imagery, audio, or video must follow the same standards as human-created content.

    - Hyper-realistic depictions of non-consenting or fictional individuals are forbidden.
    - Use of AI to create or distribute CSAM is treated identically to real CSAM.
    - Creators must disclose when content is AI-generated.
    - Datasets used for training or generation must not include non-consensual sources.

#### Section 3: Creator Responsibilities
All content creators are expected to adhere to the following standards:

- **Accurate Labeling and Tagging**
    - Accurate Labeling and Tagging: Creators are responsible for accurately labeling their content as "Adult Content", "Sensitive Content", or "NSFW Content" and using appropriate tags to describe its nature.
    - Misleading or inaccurate labeling will result in enforcement action.

- **Verification and Record-Keeping**
    - Creators must verify the age and consent of all individuals appearing in their works and maintain records in compliance with local laws (e.g., 18 U.S.C. ยง 2257 US-style obligations, where applicable).

- **Professional Conduct**
    - All creators must interact respectfully with fans, collaborators, and moderators.
    - Harassment, coercion, or manipulative practices toward others are grounds for removal from adult spaces.

- **Cooperation and Reporting**
    - Creators are expected to report violations such as CSAM, non-consensual uploads, or impersonation.
    - They must cooperate with moderation and, when required, law enforcement.

#### Section 4: Enforcement & Appeals

- **Enforcement Actions**
    Depending on severity, Gelesen may issue:
    1. Educational warning
    2. Temporary content restriction or removal
    3. Account suspension or permanent ban
    4. Referral to authorities

- **Transparency Reports**
    - Periodic transparency reports will summarize enforcement volumes, categories, and outcomes.

- **Appeals Process**
    - Users may appeal moderation decisions within 14 days of enforcement.
    - All appeals are reviewed manually by trained moderators. Repeated violations may result in permanent loss of privileges.

#### Section 5: Community Behavior & Private Spaces
Even in adult contexts, respectful conduct is required.

- **Public Interactions**
    - No harassment, solicitation, or unwanted sexual messages in comments or forums.

- **Private Chats and DMs**
    - Explicit sexual exchanges or adult roleplay are not permitted, even if consensual.
    - Private spaces must still follow platform rules to prevent exploitation and abuse.

This community guideline serves as a living document and will be periodically reviewed and updated to reflect evolving community standards, new technologies, and changes in the legal and regulatory landscape. By working together, Gelesen and its community can create a thriving and responsible space for adult content.
