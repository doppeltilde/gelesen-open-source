#### 8. Children’s Privacy

Our Service is not directed toward children under the age of **13 (or 16 in the EU)**.
If we become aware that a child has provided personal data without parental consent, we will remove it promptly.

#### 9. Age Assurance

This section outlines our approach to age assurance in compliance with age assurance requirements.

##### How We Approach Age Assurance:

Where our service, or specific parts of our service, may present content or functionalities that are harmful or inappropriate for children, we implement age assurance mechanisms. These mechanisms are designed to ascertain the age of users to ensure that children do not access such content or functionalities.

Our age assurance methods may include (but are not limited to):

- Self-declaration: Users may be asked to declare their age upon registration or when attempting to access age-restricted content.
- Verification Tools: When legally required to conduct more stringent age verification, we will only use our in-house developed machine learning (ML) age estimation system, no third-party will have access to your data.
- Supplementary verification (where necessary): In cases where our machine learning evaluation is uncertain, or if required for specific high-risk functionalities, we may, if legally permissible and necessary, request additional verification methods. This could potentially involve, for example, requesting a user to confirm their age through manual verification by our team.

##### Data We Process for Age Assurance and Estimation:

When you provide a selfie for facial age estimation, our in-house machine learning (ML) system processes the image to analyze facial features and patterns associated with age. The data extracted by the ML from the selfie is for the sole purpose of generating an age estimation.

##### We want to be clear:

- No Selfie Storage: The selfie image itself is deleted once the age estimation process has concluded.
- No Direct Identification: While the ML processes your facial features, it does so to estimate only your age, not to identify you or to create a permanent biometric profile that can be re-identified later. The processing is focused on identifying age-indicative patterns.
- Minimal Data: We only process the necessary data from the selfie to perform the age estimation.
- No training: The selfie you provide us will not be used to train our ML systems.

#### 10. Your Rights
Depending on your location (e.g., EU/EEA, UK, or US States), you may have the following rights:

- Access and receive a copy of your data.
- Request correction or removal.
- Object to processing or withdraw consent.
- Request data portability.

#### 11. Data Retention
- We retain your data only as long as necessary for the purposes described above or as required by law.
- Inactive accounts may be deleted after a certain period of time (e.g., 12 months).

#### 12. International Transfers
Your data may be processed on servers located outside your country of residence. We ensure such transfers comply with applicable data protection laws (e.g., EU Standard Contractual Clauses, or EU-US Data Privacy Framework).

#### 13. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our privacy policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of significant changes through the app. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page, unless stated otherwise.
